I emailed the president. He responded! Not after a few random messages thrown that way prior, but he did. What's funny is I had a lot on my mind. I almost do not know what I said to him when he responded. I think it was about Guam. If you look on my GitHub repo, you can find some modern social hacks. I have one there I came across in life that was about how the U.S military confuses Guam interdependence. I hope that's what he read.

As I look around, I see that my adulthood has reached me fully. My friends are gone, but for really epic reasons. I want to say it's family, but how I really feel is that some of them are Machiavellian, 'schemey,' or even evil. Some aim to participate in poverty type values, like leading with anger and fate, whilst trying to cross boundaries to make their way in this world. Some are different. They're bourgeoisie, but anti social and maladjusted, and don't mind following odd class ways. Nonetheless, as I look around, it's gloomy. I follow good doctrines, but I am human. I see that my spiritual and philosophical ideologies can only take me so far. Nature Vs nurture, but also in considering social facts, which I believe people leave out of that conversation. Hint: sociology of Marx. Writing here I hope will take me to whereI wish to go in life. Everyone around me has things, big things, careers, money, family, where I just feel very used on these sidelines of life. I am not happy. My life I feel was taken from me. The pain I went through was scary throughout my 20's. I'm 34 now, and I am sitting here still typing, creating, coding, wishing away, with nothing coming of it. I wish for change. Real change. The forces upon me are far too great for small things. I must rise to the occasion.
