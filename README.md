I emailed the president. He responded! Not after a few random messages thrown that way prior, but he did. What's funny is I had a lot on my mind. I almost do not know what I said to him when he responded. I think it was about Guam. If you look on my GitHub repo, you can find some modern social hacks. I have one there I came across in life that was about how the U.S military confuses Guam interdependence. I hope that's what he read.

<time>2022-10-04</time><br>Stupid Days<br>
As I look around, I see that my adulthood has reached me fully. My friends are gone, but for really epic reasons. I want to say it's family, but how I really feel is that some of them are Machiavellian, 'schemey,' or even evil. Some aim to participate in poverty type values, like leading with anger and fate, whilst trying to cross boundaries to make their way in this world. Some are different. They're bourgeoisie, but anti social and maladjusted, and don't mind following odd class ways. Nonetheless, as I look around, it's gloomy. I follow good doctrines, but I am human. I see that my spiritual and philosophical ideologies can only take me so far. Nature Vs nurture, but also in considering social facts, which I believe people leave out of that conversation. Hint: sociology of Marx. Writing here I hope will take me to where I wish to go in life. Everyone around me has things, big things, careers, money, family, where I just feel very used on these sidelines of life. I am not happy. My life I feel was taken from me. I'm 34 now, and I am sitting here still typing, creating, coding, wishing away. I wish for change. Real change. The forces upon me are far too great for small things. I must rise to the occasion. Little do people know that my life was filled with pain. I grew up as an INTJ, my big brother was sent to Juvi and a boys home after being a part of a Port Hueneme gang: our step dad at the time was a Hells Angel. I went a similar route to my brother, too, including truancy and crime. I broke into a fair share of businesses, schools, homes as a kid. I fought a lot, too. I was jumped a few times, cheap shotted more than several times, fist fights more than both. Confrontations are too many to count. I even dropped out of high school at 15.  The positive side is that my mom and I always helped people. My mom has been helping people in need for more than 30 years. I've always helped my friends. I went back and finished school in 2010. I also was able to get some of my music on TV and I've written a few self published books. Though it's not all where I think it should be, it's not all bad I suppose. I need money though, damn.

<time>2022-10-04</time><br>Rays of Logic<br>
Some things are best left unsaid, and I really wish this be the case, since I've gone through tons of ideas in my young adulthood. I want to add here all those ideas that I really do think might matter, and can really help set context for my life, and maybe other's lives. I want this to be a semiformal oath to be more formal with my ideas and not hang on sub par postulations that might be too simple. Some things I am referring to is, ethnic conflict being obvious in America: Mexican. Or better, middle easterners are in poverty in a large way: why for bombing? Or, if we swung as prehuman primates, why is it so farfetched that we equalized this by lower body flexion? It seems all good, until science comes along and induction doesn't do the trick. It might be a good thing to call out some things, but for me, I have seen a lot, and I can see what works. Comprehensiveness is what matters, and so inferences are only one step, and that step might not be what you want or what is right.

<time>2022-10-04</time><br>Hypnotized<br>
Many people are hypnotized thinking that were going to hit the 2040's and just miraculously upload our connectomes or whatever to the cloud. So we're going to, in 20 years, become Avatarian entities playing video games inside the web? Sounds like horseshit. In my social hacks, I mention this. Kurzweil is a Jewish musician with a business motivation: no offense. This is him, though. It's looney, and it just sounds crazy, and it makes you wonder where everyone is really going with STEM. NOT THAT FAR I ASSURE YOU. Not now. That would be totally gross, and if it is going to happen, there isn't a doubt in my mind we are being conditioned for this. I am sure somewhat mistakingly right now. I really doubt it's going down, though. We have tons of other issues, even racial and ethnic conflict, but more than anything, we have climate change, and proceeding with what MIT predicted and recent papers on deforestation and such, it's going to take a miracle to figure this all out. Who knows, but I am guessing something more realistic. Advanced neural connected mobile tech., sure. Gene editing, why not. But a Bart Simpson designer body? Eh, IDK about all that.

<time>2022-10-05</time><br>Writing<br>
I spent a lot of time on certain topics. I wrote two books, well, three actually, if including my short story Brook Harbor, but basically I spent the first half of my life playing with audio. Hence, the reason for my interest in computers and technology. Nowadays, I spent a lot of time reading about ethics, philosophy, security, and the like. I wrote a book on that, too. It's very straightforward how my books came about. I spent enough time philosophising on what it means to be a writer, too, but that is way out of bounds I might say these days, since I am not a professional writer. I became part of the Authors Guild because I thought this was logical. It may be kinda, but it is in security and ethics where I have my interests. Thus, writing is a small part of who I am. What I am is someone who likes to give people information in a particular, comprehensive and fundamental format about things that I enjoy. This is the only way I have ever learned anything: through authors who cared about this. Just to finish off, my writings are not too far apart, even though genres differ. Musicians are not the only people who need audio knowledge; many people do: students, broadcast engineers, forensic scientists, lab technicians, programmers, entrepreneurs, and the list goes on. I just wanted to make a note of that. Much of my interests stemmed from audio, though. This includes music, and I have over 200 placements on TV/Film, including America's Got talent, Hammertime, Tyler Perry's Sistas, etc. This was the beginning of my security based ethic. I was using packages, adblockers, DeleteMe, before it became what it is now: it was free, and yeah. I didn't know advanced security, or even what ports did. It was more like, give me a boot disk, converter cables, interfaces, or even a new i5 processor, but nothing like port scanning or how DNS works. This essentially healed any paranoia that I had, because now I could see that there was noone doing anything odd. I wish more people could get security awareness knowledge because this really could help a lot of people who might think robots scan their networks all day, and send them to hacker governments and all that. Do I think that's out of the question? No, but that sort of stuff is like explained by the NSA as national security concerns, in our case, and it's likely the case for other countries. Yeah, those things need to be given a go ahead by the court system. Unauthorized hacks by governments are crimes, too.

I created a repo on my GitHub for writing scripts into GIF's, and I thought it would be fun to use A.I generated art GIF's to begin. I just wanted to post some additional A.I art that was not included in the repository:

<time>2022-10-06</time><br>Life<br>
Life has in it so many altering ideas that sometimes it's just a lot to deal with. You just want to chill sometimes. When it was postulated people are hell, this is one reason for this; their life altering deceptions and lifestyles. I am grown, and my past haunts me like any other, however, I work on maintaining my gratitude. I can see past these events, such as the "told you so" in life, often from people who live with a rigid fate mentality. This is when their fate becomes your problem. Also, staying happy in general with people and what life throws at you. Not everyone is happy, and I haven't been the happiest either in recent years, but I am grateful that with these things thrown at me, I can be happy in knowing that I am not responsible for their lack of self control. I know how it sounds, but happiness seems to sorta rest on this stuff these days. People look over here, and they go, "wtf is that?" Well, it's my life, and if you're going to get mad about it, then please go. If you won't, I will. Life is life.

<time>2022-11-02</time><br>More Life<br>
Another day, another dollar. Upon my introduction of adulthood, I was a dropout. I went back at 22 to an online high school called Excel, which was accredited regionally. Before this, I worked as a Disney Cast Member at their theatre, but I had almost no education. My true introduction was after high school when I was 22. Still young, but a little late to the party. I went to University of Guam upon graduating and explored options, learned math for my placements, etc. Life seemed good, but I still didn't have a driver's license, only going to driving school in 2021 at 33. If you've been reading, my life has been pretty crazy. I took some pretty epic routes, but it seemed at the time normal. As I look back, the choices I made seems really sub par compared to now. I know programming and history, basic sciences and a lot of people knowledge, etc. All I knew before was music creating, troubleshooting, and like partying. Being an INTJ, it feels odd going down paths of mediocrity, not that I'm against it, but when I search for what I want out of life, I see a lot of sciences. I blame it on those people who think 2045 is going to happen, and those STEM and machine learning communities. They make it seem it's so normal. If it's so normal, why do I feel held back? I don't get it? Maybe life's a game, an act, a play, with the things within life a playful undertaking. If that's true, then games no more. Or let the real games begin. I've come far, reading tons of books, and adjusted or not, I can see clearly the case, with support, ya know, with Marx, with Desert Storm, Bush, all that, and current events of course (climate change). My place in all this is often a struggle. I wish not for popularity, at all, just normalcy. But what is normal? My idea of it is when people, like, cook and clean, work, plan, and engage in activities with friends or family. I do that swell, but I lack in some things. I consider this balance, or tradeoffs, a bit, however, since you can live trashy and have a degree, but another can live clean, and not have one and feel even better in life; the world is a lot like this in my opinion. I would say, a clean home, healthy nutrition, and healthy work is better than sub par life orientations. Maybe it's just me. Idk.
