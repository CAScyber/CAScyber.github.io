I emailed the president. He responded! Not after a few random messages thrown that way prior, but he did. What's funny is I had a lot on my mind. I almost do not know what I said to him when he responded. I think it was about Guam. If you look on my GitHub repo, you can find some modern social hacks. I have one there I came across in life that was about how the U.S military confuses Guam interdependence. I hope that's what he read.
