ü™ê That's about it. I'm making this a really simple site to place any
writings and philosophical ideas, concepts, etc.

Oh, and I'm an INTJüïµÔ∏è: taken officially in 2021. I always knew that, though......

I emailed the president. He responded! Not after a few random messages thrown that way prior, but he did. What's funny is I had a lot on my mind. I almost do not know what I said to him when he responded. I think it was about Guam. If you look on my GitHub repo, you can find some modern social hacks. I have one there I came across in life that was about how the U.S military confuses Guam interdependence. I hope that's what he read.

<time>2022-10-04</time><br>Stupid Days<br>
As I look around, I see that my adulthood has reached me fully. My friends are gone, but for really epic reasons. I want to say it's family, but how I really feel is that some of them are Machiavellian, 'schemey,' or even evil. Some aim to participate in poverty type values, like leading with anger and fate, whilst trying to cross boundaries to make their way in this world. Some are different. They're bourgeoisie, but anti social and maladjusted, and don't mind following odd class ways. Nonetheless, as I look around, it's gloomy. I follow good doctrines, but I am human. I see that my spiritual and philosophical ideologies can only take me so far. Nature Vs nurture, but also in considering social facts, which I believe people leave out of that conversation. Hint: sociology of Marx. Writing here I hope will take me to where I wish to go in life. Everyone around me has things, big things, careers, money, family, where I just feel very used on these sidelines of life. I am not happy. My life I feel was taken from me. I'm 34 now, and I am sitting here still typing, creating, coding, wishing away. I wish for change. Real change. The forces upon me are far too great for small things. I must rise to the occasion. Little do people know that my life was filled with pain. I grew up as an INTJ, my big brother was sent to Juvi and a boys home after being a part of a Port Hueneme gang: our step dad at the time was a Hells Angel. I went a similar route to my brother, too, including truancy and crime. I broke into a fair share of businesses, schools, homes as a kid. I fought a lot, too. I was jumped a few times, cheap shotted more than several times, fist fights more than both. Confrontations are too many to count. I even dropped out of high school at 15.  The positive side is that my mom and I always helped people. My mom has been helping people in need for more than 30 years. I've always helped my friends. I went back and finished school in 2010. I also was able to get some of my music on TV and I've written a few self published books. Though it's not all where I think it should be, it's not all bad I suppose. I need money though, damn.

<time>2022-10-04</time><br>Hypnotized<br>
Many people are hypnotized thinking that were going to hit the 2040's and just miraculously upload our connectomes or whatever to the cloud. So we're going to, in 20 years, become Avatarian entities playing video games inside the web? Sounds like horseshit. In my social hacks, I mention this. Kurzweil is a Jewish musician with a business motivation: no offense. This is him, though. It's looney, and it just sounds crazy, and it makes you wonder where everyone is really going with STEM. NOT THAT FAR I ASSURE YOU. Not now. That would be totally gross, and if it is going to happen, there isn't a doubt in my mind we are being conditioned for this. I am sure somewhat mistakingly right now. I really doubt it's going down, though. We have tons of other issues, even racial and ethnic conflict, but more than anything, we have climate change, and proceeding with what MIT predicted and recent papers on deforestation and such, it's going to take a miracle to figure this all out. Who knows, but I am guessing something more realistic. Advanced neural connected mobile tech., sure. Gene editing, why not. But a Bart Simpson designer body? Eh, IDK about all that.

I created a repo on my GitHub for writing scripts into GIF's, and I thought it would be fun to use A.I generated art GIF's to begin. I just wanted to post some additional A.I art that was not included in the repository:
